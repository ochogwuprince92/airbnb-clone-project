## 🛠️ Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**: Handles user signup, login, and profile updates. Enables secure access and user-specific data control.  
- **Property Management**: Hosts can list, edit, and delete properties. Essential for populating the platform with rentable spaces.  
- **Booking System**: Users book properties, check availability, and manage their stays. Central to the platform’s function.  
- **Payment Processing**: Manages secure financial transactions. Ensures smooth checkout and booking confirmations.  
- **Review System**: Allows users to provide feedback on listings. Builds trust within the platform.  
- **Database Optimization**: Enhances performance with indexing and caching strategies to reduce latency.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

- **Django**: A Python web framework used to build the backend APIs.  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Simplifies building and testing RESTful APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database used to store structured data.  
- **GraphQL**: Enables flexible data querying and reduces over-fetching in the frontend.  
- **Celery**: Handles background tasks like sending confirmation emails.  
- **Redis**: In-memory store used for caching and fast data access.  
- **Docker**: Containerizes the backend for consistent dev/test/deployment.  
- **CI/CD Tools** (GitHub Actions, Docker Hub): Automates testing and deployment workflows.

## 🧱 Database Design

### Key Entities and Fields

- **Users**
  - `id`: UUID  
  - `name`: string  
  - `email`: unique string  
  - `password`: hashed string  
  - `role`: enum (host, guest)

- **Properties**
  - `id`: UUID  
  - `owner`: FK to Users  
  - `title`: string  
  - `description`: text  
  - `price`: decimal

- **Bookings**
  - `id`: UUID  
  - `user`: FK to Users  
  - `property`: FK to Properties  
  - `check_in`: date  
  - `check_out`: date

- **Reviews**
  - `id`: UUID  
  - `author`: FK to Users  
  - `property`: FK to Properties  
  - `rating`: integer (1–5)  
  - `comment`: text

- **Payments**
  - `id`: UUID  
  - `booking`: FK to Bookings  
  - `amount`: decimal  
  - `status`: enum (pending, paid)

### Relationships

- A **user** can own many **properties**  
- A **property** can have many **bookings**  
- A **booking** is linked to one **user** and one **property**  
- A **review** is written by a **user** and linked to one **property**  
- A **payment** is tied to a **booking**

---

## 🔐 API Security

- **Authentication**: Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints (e.g., JWT or token-based).  
- **Authorization**: Enforces role-based access (e.g., only hosts can manage listings).  
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse through excessive requests.  
- **Data Validation**: Prevents injection and tampering via backend checks.  
- **Secure Payments**: Payment data is encrypted and handled through secure gateways.

> Security is critical to protect sensitive user data, maintain trust, and prevent financial or personal information leaks.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates testing, building, and releasing code to production safely and efficiently.

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions**: For running tests and builds on every push or pull request  
- **Docker**: To ensure consistent deployment environments  
- **Docker Hub / GitHub Packages**: For storing and deploying container images

> This pipeline helps maintain code quality, catch bugs early, and ship updates quickly.
